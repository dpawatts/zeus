     MessageBox class was changed from an Singleton to just a standard 
     (non-singleton) class.

     MessageBox class.

     X.Msg.Notify("Alert", "A Message from the Server-Side").Show();

     See more, http://forums.ext.net/showthread.php?6600	
	 
63.  The <ext:TokenScript> component has been renamed to <ext:XScript>

	 Example (Old)
	 
	 <ext:TokenScript runat="server" />
	 
	 Example (New)
	 
	 <ext:XScript runat="server" />
	 
64.  Renamed AjaxEventArgs property to DirectEventArgs

65.  Renamed AjaxMethodProxyID property to DirectMethodProxyID

66.  Renamed ComboBox and DropDownField .Icon property to .TriggerIcon. 

	 Example (Old)
	 
	 <ext:DropDownField runat="server" Icon="Search" />
	 
	 Example (New)
	 
	 <ext:DropDownField runat="server" TriggerIcon="Search" />
	 
67.  The <ext:MultiField> has been replaced with the new 
	 <ext:CompositeField>.
	 
	 The old inner <Fields> property of <ext:MultiField> should now be 
	 configured in the <Items> property of <ext:CompositeField>.
	 
68.  ColumnLayout: FitHeight property is true by default (it was false by 
     default for the 0.8.2)
 
69.  Tip.cs, changed .MinWidth and .MaxWidth property type from "int" to 
     "Unit". Default value remains the same at "40". 

70.  GridPanel, changed .MaxHeight property type from "int" to "Unit".
	 Default value remains the same at "400".

71.  GridPanel, changed .MinColumnWidth property type from "int" to "Unit"
	 Default value remains the same at "25".
	 
72.  The .HiddenId property of ComboBox was renamed to .HiddenID.
	 Functionality remains the same.
	 
73.  Renamed the Field.cs property .IsNull to .IsEmpty.

74.  Renamed the Field.cs property .NullValue to .EmptyValue.

75.  Renamed the standard first parameter of Component Listener arguments 
     to "item". Previous parameter name was "el". 
     
     The argument "item" is automatically passed as the first argument of 
     the Listener function Handler. 
        
     The scope of "this" is an instance of the Component which fired the
     event. 
        
     Both "item" and "this" will refer to the same Component instance.
     
     It is recommended that developers refer to the Component instance as 
     "this", instead of "item", although both will work. 
     
     Using "this" instead of "item" will avoid any future breaking 
     changes.
     
     Example
     
     <ext:Panel runat="server" Title="Example">
	    <Listeners>
		    // Old
			<Hide Handler="alert(el);" />
	        
			// New
			<Hide Handler="alert(item);" />
	        
			// Recommended
			<Hide Handler="alert(this);" />
		</Listeners>
	 </ext:Panel>

76.  GroupName property of Radio widget is removed. Please use Name property.
     Please note that GroupName property of RadioGroup still exists (RadioGroup's GroupName is applied to each child Radio if AutomaticGrouping is true)
	
77.  LowerCase of RendererFormat enum is renamed to Lowercase (to correct name serialization)

78.  Renamed the ResourceManager property .RemoveViewState to .DisableViewState. 

     Example (old)
	 
	 <ext:ResourceManager runat="server" RemoveViewState="true" />
	 
	 Example (new)
	 
	 <ext:ResourceManager runat="server" DisableViewState="true" />
	 
79.  In prior releases, the Store .Load Listener was previously delayed by
     10 milliseconds. This delay was removed as of v1.0 RC2.

	 Projects configured to use the .Load Listener may require setting a
	 10 millisecond delay. 

	 Example

	 <Load Handler="..." Delay="10" />
