- ChildEditors now no longer create fieldsets - so if you want them to 
  be in a container, you will need to create a container in the parent 
  content type - see FormPage / Form as an example.

- Existing ECommerce sites might break with this version - hopefully
  the changes required will be clear.

- Added Icon property to ContentItem. This is the simplest way
  to set the icon, using the Ext.Net.Icon enumeration.
- Removed IconName from BaseContentItem since it's no longer needed.
- Deleted famfamfam embedded icons since they were duplicating
  the Ext.Net.Icon ones.

- Widgets are no longer shown in the tree view. To manage widgets,
  right click the page in the tree and choose Manage Zones. In the
  Manage Zones panel, you can drag/drop widgets to re-order them
  or move them into a different zone. You can also add widgets by
  clicking the zone name and then the Add button. You can delete
  widgets by clicking the widget and then the Delete button.
